* Compilation
1. Install Haskell toolchain (https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/, I use GHC 9.6.5
   and =cabal=).

2. Compile:

   #+name: Compilation
   #+begin_src sh :exports
     cabal build
     cabal install
   #+end_src

 Check that the path of the installed binary is in your =PATH=.

* Usage
#+name: Usage
#+begin_src sh :exports
  pnpm run lint | fix-imports
#+end_src
